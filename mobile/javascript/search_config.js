Taiwan's Mountains and Geo-energy from the                           Perspective of Metamorphic Structures                      Speaker: Gong-Ruei Ho                      Gong-Ruei  Ho  is  a  researcher  in  the  Geology  Division,  specializing  in                    Geology Department Rock and Minerals Division, at the National Museum                     of Natural Science (NMNS). His research focuses on the structural analysis                    of metamorphic rocks and orogenic processes. He is particularly interested                    in  the  geometric  relationships  of  metamorphic  rocks  and  geological                    mapping, integrating field investigations with microstructural analysis to                    explore  the  orogenic  dynamics  and  rock  evolution  in  Taiwan  and  the                     Western  Pacific  subduction  zone.  In  recent  years,  he  has  extended  his                    multi-scale rock deformation studies to practical applications, addressing                    sustainable energy and environmental issues such as geothermal resource                     development,  carbon  sequestration,  and  nuclear  waste  disposal.                    Additionally,  He  actively  promotes  science  education,  transforming  his                    research findings into exhibitions and educational programs to inspire and                    engage younger generations in Earth sciences.
